# About VTS

## Overview

This guide will help you deploy, test, and use the Argus Video Training System (VTS). Originally developed for training underground heavy vehicle operators remotely, Argus works equally well for any situation where you need live video feeds deployed quickly. Everything you need comes in durable hard cases designed for fast setup anywhere.

## Battery Charging

A charging system is not included with the VTS kit. We recommend the **Milwaukee M12-18C3 12V - 18V Multi Voltage Rapid 6-Battery Charger Station** for efficient battery management and reduced downtime.
