# Remote Camera Systems

## Overview

Remote Camera Systems (RCS) are portable video streaming cameras that quickly attach to training vehicles. No external power needed – fully wireless operation.

### Key Specifications

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Power** | 12V/3Ah Milwaukee battery pack |
| **Battery Life** | 12 hours per charge |
| **Mounting** | Magnetic or suction cup |
| **Operation** | Fully wireless |
| **Video Quality** | HD streaming |
| **Count** | Up to 4 cameras per system |

## Mounting on Vehicle

### Exterior Mounting (Magnetic)

For general vehicle observation using magnetic mount:

1. **Clean the mounting surface** - Ensure metal surface is clean and dry
2. **Position the camera** - Attach magnetically to metal surface on vehicle exterior
3. **Adjust angle** - Position for required views of equipment or area
4. **Check connection** - Verify secure mounting and stable position

**Typical Exterior Positions:**
- Rear of vehicle (top of equipment)
- Front corners for bucket/blade view
- Side positions for full equipment view

### Interior Mounting (Suction Cup)

For cab/trainee monitoring using suction cup mount:

1. **Choose window location** - Select clean glass surface inside cab
2. **Clean the glass** - Use dry, clean cloth for best suction
3. **Apply suction cup** - Press firmly to create seal
4. **Adjust camera** - Position to capture trainee actions clearly
5. **Verify stability** - Ensure camera doesn't move during operation

:::warning
Make sure suction cups are fully seated and glass is clean for reliable mounting.

## Camera Sync

### Power On Procedure

To sync the camera once the access points are meshed:

1. **Power on the cameras** using the same method as access points:
   - Press the large black power button firmly
   - Release the button
   - Wait for the unit to boot

2. **LED Indicators**:
   - Status LED Ring will illuminate **red** when powered
   - A faint **clicking noise** will be heard as the lens calibrates

3. **Waiting for Sync**:
   - Camera will automatically connect to the mesh network
   - Allow 10-15 seconds for full initialization
   - Green LED indicates ready status

### Multi-Camera Setup

When using multiple cameras:

1. Turn on access points first (allow mesh to establish)
2. Turn on each camera sequentially (5 second intervals)
3. Verify all cameras show green LED status
4. Check Argus software shows all camera feeds

## Battery Life

Plan battery usage carefully for all-day operations:

- **Single charge**: 12 hours continuous operation
- **All-day deployment**: Have backup batteries available
- **Swap rotation**: Rotate batteries between training sessions
- **Charging time**: Plan overnight charging for used batteries

### Battery Management Tips

✅ Have 2-3 batteries per camera for rotation  
✅ Charge overnight or between sessions  
✅ Store charged batteries in cool, dry location  
✅ Monitor battery level before each deployment  
✅ Never operate below safe minimum charge  

## Camera Adjustment

Cameras can be adjusted to face any position:

- **Tilt**: Adjust up/down approximately ±45 degrees
- **Pan**: Adjust left/right with magnetic mount rotation
- **Zoom**: Digital zoom available in Argus software
- **Focus**: Automatic focus calibration on startup
