# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Access Points Won't Power On

**Problem**: AP doesn't turn on when power button is pressed

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ Check battery is installed in the AP
2. ✅ Verify battery has charge (try different battery)
3. ✅ Hold power button firmly for 2 seconds (may need firm press)
4. ✅ Clean battery contacts if corroded
5. ✅ Try different power button if stuck

### Access Point LED Stays Blue Too Long

**Problem**: AP LED remains blue (not turning green) for over 30 seconds

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ Verify line of sight to other APs (no obstructions)
2. ✅ Move AP to higher position
3. ✅ Reduce distance to nearest AP (move within 50-100m)
4. ✅ Reposition AP away from metal mesh depressions
5. ✅ Power cycle (off, wait 10s, on)

### Network Shows Red Connection Status

**Problem**: Argus software shows red in network health monitoring panel

**Immediate Actions**:
1. ✅ STOP all training operations
2. ✅ Check all AP LEDs are green (not blue or red)
3. ✅ Verify cameras are in range of APs
4. ✅ Check for obstruction between APs
5. ✅ Reposition APs and re-test

**Long-term Fix**:
- Ensure minimum 30m spacing between static APs
- Improve line of sight between APs
- Add repeater AP if needed
- Move Trainer AP closer if possible

### Camera Won't Sync to Network

**Problem**: Camera LED doesn't turn green after power on

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ Verify access points are all on green status first
2. ✅ Power cycle camera (off, wait 5s, on)
3. ✅ Move camera closer to nearest access point
4. ✅ Check line of sight isn't blocked
5. ✅ Try different battery (may be low power)
6. ✅ Power on camera after all APs are green (not before)

### One Camera Feed is Missing from Argus Software

**Problem**: Only 3 cameras showing when 4 are connected

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ Verify camera LED is green (powered and connected)
2. ✅ Power cycle the missing camera
3. ✅ Restart Argus software
4. ✅ Check camera hasn't failed (try moving to different mount)
5. ✅ Verify connection order (cameras should appear in sequence)

### Tablet Won't Connect to WiFi

**Problem**: Can't find or connect to ARGUS-VTS-XXX network

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ Verify Trainer AP (AP-1) is powered on (should show green LED)
2. ✅ Verify WiFi network name shows up in available networks
3. ✅ Try connecting with password: **BarmincoVTS**
4. ✅ Power cycle Trainer AP and try again
5. ✅ Restart tablet if connection still fails
6. ✅ Verify tablet WiFi is enabled

### Poor Video Quality / Freezing

**Problem**: Video stream is choppy, freezes, or has poor resolution

**Causes & Solutions**:

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Poor network signal | Reposition APs for better coverage |
| Too many recordings | Reduce number of simultaneous recordings |
| Camera too far from AP | Move camera closer or add repeater AP |
| Interference | Ensure 30m+ spacing between static APs |
| Low battery | Replace with fresh battery |

### Recording Files Are Corrupted

**Problem**: Recorded video files won't play back

**Prevention**:
1. ✅ Stop recording before powering down system
2. ✅ Ensure adequate disk space during recording
3. ✅ Use tablets built-in storage, not external drives
4. ✅ Don't move files while recording

**Recovery**:
- Try opening with different video player
- Re-record the session if possible

### Tablet Overheating During Recording

**Problem**: Tablet gets very hot during extended recording

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ Ensure tablet has adequate air circulation
2. ✅ Avoid extended recordings over 2 hours without break
3. ✅ Reduce frame rate or resolution in settings
4. ✅ Point tablet away from direct sun
5. ✅ Allow cooling break every 1-2 hours

### Network Disconnects During Operation

**Problem**: Video feed drops or system loses connection mid-training

**Root Causes**:
- Access point moved or repositioned
- Trainee moved too far from network
- Equipment (vehicle) blocking line of sight
- Interference from external sources

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ Pause training
2. ✅ Verify all AP LEDs are green
3. ✅ Check line of sight isn't blocked by vehicle
4. ✅ Reposition if needed
5. ✅ Resume once network is stable

## System Validation Checklist

Before each training session, verify:

- [ ] All AP batteries are charged
- [ ] All APs power on and show green LED
- [ ] Tablet has sufficient battery charge
- [ ] Tablet connects to WiFi successfully
- [ ] All 4 cameras power on and show green LED
- [ ] Argus software shows all camera feeds
- [ ] Network health shows green or orange (not red)
- [ ] Test recording starts and stops cleanly
- [ ] Recording storage has adequate free space
- [ ] All camera views are clear and unobstructed
