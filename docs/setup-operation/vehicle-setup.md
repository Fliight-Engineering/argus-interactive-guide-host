# Vehicle Setup

## Machine AP Position

For underground loader training, mount the machine AP on the rear of the vehicle on top of the radiator.

### Requirements

This location must provide:

- ✅ **Clear line-of-sight** to both other AP units
- ✅ **Strong radio signal** to all vehicle cameras (RCS)
- ✅ **Protection from physical damage**
- ✅ **Elevated position** for optimal signal propagation

### Mounting Steps

1. Complete the 5-step Machine AP physical setup (see Setup & Operation)
2. Position on rear of vehicle, on top of radiator
3. Mount securely to prevent movement during operation
4. Verify direct line of sight to Trainer and/or Repeater APs
5. Power on and verify solid green LED indicates good mesh connection

:::warning
Do NOT mount in depressions or low points - signal needs clear line of sight to other access points and all cameras.

## RCS Camera Positions

The following diagrams show the recommended placements of the machine AP and RCS cameras around an Underground Loader. They may be adjusted as required to suit your operation.

### Rear Quarter View

*Rear quarter view of training vehicle, with the machine node and rear mag cam placements*

Mount rear camera to observe:
- Rear quarter view showing machine node position
- Rear attachment points and bucket positioning
- Ground behind vehicle
- Overall vehicle operation from behind

### Forward Bucket View

*Forward view of the training vehicle, with mag cam position for viewing the bucket from above*

Mount forward-facing camera to observe:
- Bucket positioning and movement from above
- Loading technique
- Material engagement
- Forward ground surface conditions

### Front Bucket and Tire View

*Front view of the training vehicle, with mag cam position for viewing the bucket and offside tyre*

Mount front side camera to observe:
- Bucket approach angle
- Tire position relative to obstacles
- Side clearances
- Bucket cutting edge alignment

### Cab Interior (Trainee Monitoring)

Mount interior camera using **suction cups on glass** to observe:
- Trainee position in operator cabin
- Control inputs and operating technique  
- Trainee awareness and reactions
- Proper cab procedures

### Typical 4-Camera Setup

For comprehensive training observation:

| Camera | Mount Location | Mount Type | Purpose |
|--------|----------------|------------|---------|
| Camera 1 | Rear quarter | Magnetic | Rear view and machine node visibility |
| Camera 2 | Front/Top | Magnetic | Forward bucket view from above |
| Camera 3 | Front side | Magnetic | Bucket and tire positioning |
| Camera 4 | Cab interior | Suction cup | Trainee observation and technique |

:::note Camera Positioning
**NOTE**: These are recommended camera positions, but they can be set up in many configurations that suit the training purpose. Cameras can be adjusted to face any required position.

## Alternative Configurations

Depending on your training needs, you might use:

- **2-camera setup**: Rear + Cab for basic training
- **3-camera setup**: Rear + Front + Cab for standard training
- **4-camera setup**: Rear + Front + Side + Cab for comprehensive training
- **Custom setup**: Any combination that matches your specific needs

## Position Verification

After mounting all cameras:

1. Verify each camera has line of sight to Machine AP
2. Ensure cameras are secure and won't move during operation
3. Confirm no blind spots in critical viewing areas
4. Test each camera feed in Argus software
5. Adjust positions if any feed is poor quality

## Cable Management

- Keep camera cables away from moving parts
- Secure cables to prevent snagging
- Protect cables from sharp edges
- Leave slack for vehicle articulation
