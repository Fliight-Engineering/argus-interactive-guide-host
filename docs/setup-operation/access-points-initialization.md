## Machine Access Point Setup

The Machine AP is designed to provide optimal antenna placement when operation but to pack away compactly for storage, thus, it requires a simple physical setup for deployment. The steps are as follows:

1. Pick the Machine AP up out of the hard case and fold out the lower two antennas

2. Unclip the Antenna mast and rotate it towards the upward position

3. Pull the latch loop and engage the locking pin once the mast is in the vertical position

4. Rotate two of the antennas so that their elbow joints point upwards and fold all antennas at their 45 degree latched position

The Machine node is now ready to be mounted & powered on.
